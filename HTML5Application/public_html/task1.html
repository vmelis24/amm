        <h1>Preface</h1>
        <p>
            The last few years have seen a dramatic upsurge in research in end user programming. Much of this
renewed interest is due to the popularity of the Web. The Web browser is rapidly replacing the
personal computer’s desktop as the platform for many computer activities, and users can now find
information, make purchases, and communicate with each other through a Web browser.
As Chapter 1 explains, the Web browser has turned out to be an ideal platform for end user pro-
gramming. Researchers and students at a variety of institutions have been exploring how Web brow-
sers can be changed or augmented to better support everyday users’ tasks. Some of these systems
have even been released for public use. Unfortunately, there was no common community linking
researchers in this area together. As a result, there was relatively little collaboration between differ-
ent groups and papers describing work in this area were published in a variety of different academic
venues. Not only was this hurting the productivity of the field, but it was preventing the potential
beneficiaries, such as Web users and developers, from accessing these technologies. As researchers
working this area ourselves, the four of us felt that it was time to foster a community for researchers in
end user programming on the Web.

        <h2 id="primo">“End-User Programming on the Web” workshop at ACM SIGCHI</h2>
        
        <p>We began by organizing a workshop at the SIGCHI conference (ACM Conference on Human
Factors in Computing Systems) in April 2009. The goals of this workshop were three-fold: (1) to bring
together researchers from a variety of institutions and establish a sense of community, (2) to discuss
common problems and share lessons from our work, and (3) to plan the publication of an edited book
on this topic. The goal of the book was to make it easy for researchers to read about the latest
approaches and innovations in the field and to make this interesting topic more readily available
to a larger audience.
The one-day workshop was attended by 32 participants representing 20 different institutions
across three continents (Asia, Europe, and North America). Participants were selected based on short
position papers that were submitted in advance of the workshop. We personally invited a number of
people to submit position papers on the basis of their previously published work, and we also con-
ducted an open call for position papers from the research community at large. The authors of all sub-
missions related to end user programming on the Web were invited to attend the workshop, with the
condition that attendees were also required to prepare a book chapter by our prespecified deadlines.
We began the workshop with each participant giving a one-minute talk about their work in the space
of end user programming on the Web. We then asked five attendees to give longer presentations cover-
ing some of the key projects and areas of interest to our research community. The remainder of the
workshop was spent alternating between break-out groups and full-group discussion in areas of interest
to our research community and specific topics regarding the book. Several of these breakout sessions
were instrumental in helping us establish a coherent organization for the book.</p>

           Overview of the book
        </h2>
        
        <p>This book brings together the state of the art in interface and language design, system architectures,
research methodologies, and evaluation strategies for end user programming on the Web. The book
        compiles seventeen systems (Chapters 3–19) and offers a concise system summary at the end of each
system chapter that lists such characteristics as intended users, domain, and scripting ability, and
enables direct comparison between all of the systems. Video demonstrations of the systems are avail-
able on the Morgan Kaufmann Web site at www.mkp.com/nocoderequired.

        <h3 id="terzo">ntroduction (Chapters 1–2)</h3>
        <p>Chapters 1 and 2 look back at the field of end user programming since its beginnings in the 1980s
and discuss the resurgence of this research area in the Web domain. They point to the extensibility
of the Web browser and the open nature of HTML as differentiating factors that have enabled end
user customization and automation across many different tasks and applications on the Web.</p>
        
        
        <h3 id="quarto">Customizing and automating (Chapters 3–7)
</h3>
        
        <p>The second section of the book focuses on approaches for enabling automation and customization of
the Web. We survey five systems – Chickenfoot (Chapter 3), Creo (Chapter 4), CoScripter (Chapter
5), Highlight (Chapter 6), and Atomate (Chapter 7) – that leverage a variety of techniques, including
inventing a new human readable scripting language, allowing programming by example, and lever-
aging a large knowledge base of semantic information.</p>
        
        <h3 id="quinto">Mashups (Chapters 8–11)</h3>
        <p>This section includes four systems – C3W (Chapter 8), Mash Maker (Chapter 9), d.mix (Chapter 10),
and ITL (Chapter 11) – that mix information from multiple Web sites and applications to create
mashups. Their approaches vary from proposing a specialized platform to building on top of the
Web browser and mapping the interface to existing Web services.</p>
        
        <h3 id="sesto">Visualization and exploration (Chapters 12–14)</h3>
        <p>Incontrasttothe systems described earlierinthe book, the three systems inthis section – Web Summaries
(Chapter 12), Zoetrope (Chapter 13), and RecipeSheet (Chapter 14) – focus on providing end user
customization tools for visualizing and exploring the large amounts of data that live on the Web.</p>
        
        <h3 id="settimo">Natural language (Chapters 15–17)</h3>
        <p>Any type of Web customization is possible through code, but writing code – at least as it exists today
– is not the right interface for most Web customization tasks. The three systems in this section – Inky
(Chapter 15), PLOW (Chapter 16), and MOOIDE (Chapter 17) – propose new approaches to
programming that are inspired by or incorporate natural language.</p>
        
        <h3 id="ottavo">Accessibility (Chapters 18–19)</h3>
        <p>A large portion of Web content does not conform to accessibility standards, making it difficult
for visually impaired users to use the Web. The systems in this section – Social Accessibility
        (Chapter 18) and TrailBlazer (Chapter 19) – leverage third-party tagging and demonstrations to
improve Web accessibility.</p>
        
        <h3 id="nono">User studies (Chapters 20–23)</h3>
        <p>We conclude the book with four ethnographic user studies that provide a deep understanding for the
target end users and their needs for Web use, code reuse, and debugging.</p>
